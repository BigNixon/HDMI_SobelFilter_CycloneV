# HDMI SobelFilter#
 It is implemented on DE10 nano (Cyclone V SoC 5CSEBA6U23I7) development board. The HDMI Transmitter chip used is **ADV7513** by analog devices and Sobel filter
- Sobel filter implementation by [Marco Winzker ](https://github.com/Marco-Winzker "Marco Winzker ")
- For HDMI chip embedded on de10nano development board is used the test by I2C configuration by [nhasbun](https://github.com/nhasbun/de10nano_vgaHdmi_chip "nhasbun") 
- Pin assignments done by Quartus EDA tool

# PROGRAMMING DE10NANO #
* Connect the board via JTAG
